# BMI Predictor
In this project I have made a BMI class predictor NOT USING THE FORMULA.
I have trained this on the weight and height data.
I also had to do some data pre processing.
I have used Random Forest Classifier.
We can also find out optimal number of n-estimators by running the graph part in the last.
You can also check your BMI class by entering your data in the last cell.
