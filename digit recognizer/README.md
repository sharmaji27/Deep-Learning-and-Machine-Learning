# DIGIT RECOGNIZER

This project is a digit recognizer made using support vector machine algorithm of machine learning. 
I on my own created the image dataset. 
If you want you can also generate data by opening image gen.
A 255 X 255 window will pop up and before that it will ask you that what number are you going to write.
Then just draw the number and hit enter 2(sometimes 3) times and your image will be saved in the respective folder and your canvas will get automatically cleared.
But while doing this you ave to make sure that you are saving images in the respective numerical folders.  
After the image data is created you have to convert it into csv form so run the file dataset generator. 
And your data is created. 
I have saved the best odel under model section , you can directly import from here also by commenting the model.fit line in training code.
you will have to run the training file several times to get the highest accuracy. 
And then you are ready to predict the handwritten digits.
for predictions you just have to draw the number on the window pop up and it will try its best to predict.
