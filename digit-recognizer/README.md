# digit-recognizer
This project is a digit recognizer made using support vector machine algorithm of machine learning.
The image data created is made by myself only.
If you want you can also generate data by opening image generator in sublime or pycharm or any other platform and add more images.
But while doing this you ave to make sure that you are saving images in the respective numerical folders.
After the image data is created you have to convert it into csv form so run the file dataset generator.
And after this your data is created.
Then run the training file sveral times till you get the highest accuracy.
And then you are ready to predict the handwritten digits.
There's a pre requisite for this that you have to split your screen where first half is your paint with canvas size of 255*255 and background should be black and forecolour should be white and other half is your pycharm or others.
Then just write the digit on the canvas and run the predict file and it will predict it.
